<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The idea behind this project, is to make a very minimalist control app
to toggle a Tasmota driven fan that i have at home, feel free to contribute
or fork it to change it to whatever you need. The app will poll the switch state
using Tasmota's WEB API and toggle the fan to ON/OFF state.

It's a pure React Native app. No dependencies.
